# nish

[ni](https://github.com/antfu/ni) but implemented in bash (and probably faster)

## Installation

[jq](https://github.com/jqlang/jq) is required. [gum](https://github.com/charmbracelet/gum) is recommended, since some features that require input won't work without it at the moment.

In order to install, simply add the `bin` folder to your `PATH`. `chmod +x` if you run into `permission denied` errors.

You can also also install with Nix by using `nix profile install github:ryanccn/nish` :)
